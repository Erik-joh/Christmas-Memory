## Code Review
* By Dominic Kersch
* script.js: L208-L220 - I suggest line breaks at positions in your template literal which make the contents a little easier to read.
* index.html: L13-L33 - It's recommended to not place sections inside sections and keep them at the same level. Perhaps the outer or inner section(s) could be changed to a different tag type.
* index.html: L13-L33 - It's recommended to use consistent indentation and spacing to make for easy reading.
* style.css: L121 & L136 - Avoid using negative Z-index values in general as positioned elements can get buried underneath the body or html elements. Use them only if that is what you want.
* I suggest adding a repo description to your project so that visitors to your GitHub can briefly understand what the project is about. Very importantly, it's also advised to add a Xmas themed .gif!
